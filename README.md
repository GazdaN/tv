#### Additional setup for Docker Toolbox (Windows 10 Home):
Look for every `localhost` in the database config files (`cable.yml` and `database.yml`) and replace it with the IP address of the docker-machine (e.g. `192.168.99.100`). You can find this IP address with following command: 

```
docker-machine ip
```
